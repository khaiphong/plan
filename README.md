It starts at one's Thinking processes of connecting ideas similar to <a href="https://www.mindmaps.com/how-to-make-a-mind-map" target="_blank">Mind Maps</a> but in formal node type; one of which is "<b>note</b>" similar to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep" target="_blank">Google Keep</a> for quickly organizing cloud-based Tasks and/or Events, etc, where the "<b>Inner Space</b>" node is the starting HTML page in your <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/home/" target="_blank">Home Personal online data (Pod)</a> having  FREE "<b>Conversation with yourself in your 100% securely private corner</b>" to actively <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/fibonacci-layered-inner-space.html" target="_blank">"<b>Cultivate your Inner Space</b>"</a> as SHARED by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoice8SNxko" target="_blank">Vietnamese Circle</a> which will be (1) <b>much more fruitful and easier</b> with <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">Discovered Underlying Natural Laws</a> to naturally "<b>#EmptyTheContent in transcendental Awareness / Wu-Nien</b>" and their visible outcomes from all civilizations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcxW64SR_2A" target="_blank">Yogic Flying</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98XJ_XuHlGA" target="_blank">Qi Gong</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwX656mmcvk" target="_blank">Prana Dynamics</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEaPQE53XZk" target="_blank">Singing</a>, Dancing, Music Playing, Camping and Merging with Nature, Relaxing, etc, plus (2) visual drag-and-drop grouping similar to "<b>What’s new in Google Chrome</b>".

It starts at a "<b>system type Node</b>" either as a "<b>note of thinking</b>" and/or drilled down as a "<b>struct of Rust</b>" in  [ <b>Plan &gt;&lt; Execution &gt;&lt; Feedback</b> ], and the executions of these ideas in building the digital neural networks from your <b><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">Inner Space</a> &gt;&lt; <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_11.1" target="_blank">Outter Spaces</a></b> at different mathematically measurable (briefly covered here in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlKAna21fLE&t=614s" target="_blank">linear algebra</a>) and statistically verifiable practical angles - as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ktniq_NBnE" target="_blank">"<b>SHARED</b>" Cuộc sống là kết quả các hành động / Life is the result of actions</a>, then by many others of <b>No-Conflict Consciousness (Oneness)</b> from different aspects of conflicting Dualities such as religions, nationalities, civilizations, skin colors, etc,  already identified as parts of <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_platform/" target="_blank">kp_platform</a> - to outer <b>Activities via Organizations and Relationships, etc</b>. 

It is similar to other <b>"paperless notes" mixed with handwritten notes you can store in the cloud and offline of your distributed private database</b> on a generic computer / notepad which we <b>expect to have features</b> similar to <b>Supernote</b> where "<b>handwriting</b>" and "<b>voice</b>" can be parts of the "<b>connecting nodes</b>". Thanks to standardization and Rust, we enable the <b>entire code-bases seem to be developed by a single developer</b> for easy maintenance and further development.
